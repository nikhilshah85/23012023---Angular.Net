			1. When did you use internet first time - World average 2004
			2. Why did users used internet for in those days - 
				Surfing, email, chatting, view my results
			3. Where did ppl used internet those days - Home, Cybercafe, universities
			4. Source of Internet - Modem - PhoneConnection - Broadband
			5. How did ppl used internet - desktop - laptop 

			6. We had been given XML - SOAP - data for cross platform communication

	Thus web developers created web contents accordingly, and thus technology was in accordance
		ASP.net, JSP, PHP etc... (old tech now a days)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			Today
		2. Why do users used internet for in these days - for everything
		3. Where do ppl used internet these days - Everywhere
		4. Source of Internet - Mobile data - wifi
		5. How did ppl used internet - Mobile - Tables - Watches - IOT devises
		6. XML - SOAP - data for cross platform communication - is super slow, costly, heavy

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Thus we need a better way to developer applications, process the request and response
	Give better user experienceto end user

		Thus a new psycology, terminology came in
		Create a Single Paged Appliction (SPA App)

		Divever a single page to user, this singe page is made up of many pages
			Navigation will happen on client devise

		user will come to server only for new data, for UI
			communication is changed from XML-SOAP to JSON - lightest and fastest

--------
		Focus is now changed from Server Centeric APP (ASP.Net / JAVA) 
		to 
		client centeric app

		Client Devise understands only - HTML, CSS and JS (this languages has their own drawbacks)
				They are not OOPS based

			Thus W3C and ECMA (European Computer Manufacturing Association)
				came up with ES6 (Ecma Script) - which is Object Oriented Javascript

			Problem - Syntax is from another world - not at all convinent 
			Thus Microsoft - developed a compier and a languge with keywords based on ES6
				called it as TypeScript

			useing TS - Google developed a Client Centeric development framework 
					Angular - which will run on Node




			A shifted focus from developing Server Centeric APP to Client centeric app
				is the new Web

		pause for 3 mins - quiestions if any
		
		Next : Angular Development Setup (3-4 mins)
				a. NodeJS
					https://nodejs.org/en/
				b. VS Code
					https://code.visualstudio.com/download
				c. Angular CLI
					this gets installed by NPM - node package manager
					this is installed along with Node installation

				npm install @angular/cli - this will install the latest version of angular
				npm install @angular/cli@11.0 - for any specific version


		       First Angular Application
