				Services in Angular



	Share the logic between multiple components (functions / methods )
	Share the data between multiple components (any data)

	-------------------------------------------
	Once you create a service, there are 2 ways to use them

	1. create a new object of the service class,and call methods, properties etc whereever needed
		--you take care of object destruction
		--you take care of refrences, memory leak, memory release etc......
		--object will be created in memory and use the memory when component is active, even though you 			do not use any method of any property of that object
		-- data will not be in sync when 2 components creates 2 differnt objects in application

	2. Use DI - dependency injection, which will lazy load and give bettern performance
		--Object will be created by Angular runtime
		-- data will be shared accross multiple components
		--data will be in sync


	------------------------------------------------
